/*
6.	Repeat Passenger Frequency and City Contribution Analysis
â€¢	Analyse the frequency of trips taken by repeat passengers in each city (e.g., % of repeat passengers taking 2 trips, 3 trips, etc.). 
	Identify which cities contribute most to higher trip frequencies among repeat passengers, and examine if there are distinguishable patterns 
	between tourism-focused and business-focused cities.
